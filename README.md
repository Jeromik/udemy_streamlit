## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation

This project is part of the [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/) training course that I propose with a double objective:

1) Learn how to use Streamlit.io, a Python framework that allows to develop data/ML applications and commonly used by Data Scientists. 
2) Develop a web application to analyze the stock prices of S&P500 companies.

Here is a preview of the final version of the application developed in this directory : 

*Step 1 : S&P500 Screener*

*Step 2 : S&P500 Stock Analysis*

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation of the directory

Here is the architecture of the course directory :

The `initial_version` directory contains the same files as the `final_version` directory. The difference is that the files in the `initial_version` directory are empty and will be completed with the explanations during the training.

You will find all the answers in the `final_version` directory.

Then, within these 2 folders, you will find :
- An `exercise` folder: With all the exercises of the course.
- A `project` folder in which you will find the 3 successive steps of the final project (the S&P500 prediction application) : `final_project_basics.py` / `final_project_interactions.py` / `final_project.py`

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to work with this directory

In order to work on this directory, you have to download it locally on your own computer. 

To do this, open a terminal and place yourself in the folder of your choice in order to store the project folder (with the `cd` command) then clone the folder by executing the command :

`git clone https://github.com/pierre-louis-danieau/udemy_streamlit.git`

Congratulations, you should see the directory appear locally on your computer. You can now open the project with your favorite editor (VScode, Pycharm, Spyder...)!

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exercices folder

The `exercises` folder is composed of 4 subfolders:
- streamlit_basics : Python file on the basics of streamlit + input files (an audio recording, a photo, a video)
- streamlit_interactions : Python file for training on streamlit widgets which allow to interact with the user.
- streamlit_visualizations : Python file for training on how to create graphics in streamlit.
- streamlit_advanced_features : Python file for training on the more advanced components of streamlit.


## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Projects folder

The `project` folder is composed of 5 subfiles:

You will find :
- `final_project_basics.py` : The first step of the application with what was seen in the streamlit_basics training part.
- `final_project_interactions.py` : The second step of the application with what was seen in the streamlit_interactions training part.
- `final_project.py`: The third and last step of the application with what was seen in the streamlit_visualizations and streamlit_advanced_features training part.
- **s&p500.csv**: The csv file of most of the S&P500 companies with some indicators like market capitalization, dividend ratio...
- **stock.jpeg**: A picture used in the layout of the application.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ How to execute the streamlit applications

In order to run the python files in the `exercises` folder (there is a 's' because it is equivalent for the 2 `exercice` folder), you need to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies that are in the `requirements_exerices.txt` file.

To do this:
1) Open a terminal and go to the exercise folder: 

`cd final_version/exercises/`

2) Install virtualenv : 

`pip install virtualenv`

3) Create the virtual environment : 

`virtualenv env`

4) Activate it : 

`source venv/bin/activate`

5) Install dependencies : 

`pip install -r requirements_exercises.txt`

Once the installation of the dependencies is finished, you can run all the python files which are in the 2 directories exercises (`initial_version/exercises/` and `final_version/exercises/`) with the command : `streamlit run file_name.py`.

For example, go to the `udemy_streamlit/final_version/exercises/` directory and run :

`streamlit run basic.py`

You should see a web window with a streamlit application!

PS : The version of Python used during this training is : 3.9.6
